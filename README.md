# aws-magic

Assuming that the default `aws` cli user has been set up, these aws scripts take care of launching various instances.

Based on [the fastai course](https://github.com/fastai/courses/tree/master/setup).

E.g., launch a base Ubuntu 16.04 in Oregon (instructions printed on terminal):

    ./oregon-ubuntu16.04-p2.xlarge.sh my-p2-name
    
If you have a live instance running (generated by a script such as the above), then you can install my deep learning setup on it (provided you want TensorFlow, Keras, my .bashrc, etc.). See `server-install-deeplearn.sh` for details, and to start the install on your laptop use:

    ./interactive-server-install-deeplearn.sh
